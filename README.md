# CutClean

This is an example addon for my simple bukkit ScenarioManager (https://github.com/Elllzman619/ScenarioManager).  It can be loaded as normal onto  any spigot / bukkit server by placing  a compiled .jar in the /plugins/ directory. The plugin  depends on ScenarioManager and will not load if it is not also enabled on the server.

The plugin can be accessed using the ScenarioManager plugins command tree, reference the Readme.MD for that plugin for help using the plugin once loaded.
